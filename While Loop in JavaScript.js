                                   While Loop in JavaScript
A while loop is a control flow statement that allows you to repeatedly execute a block of code as long as a specified condition evaluates to true. It is one of the fundamental loop constructs in JavaScript and is used when the number of iterations is not known beforehand.

Syntax:
    while (condition) {
        // Code to be executed as long as the condition is true
    }
*/

let i = 1;
while (i < 20) {
console.log(i);
i++;
}
