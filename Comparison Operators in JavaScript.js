Comparison Operators in JavaScript:

Equality (==): This operator compares two values to see if they are equal.

Inequality (!=): This operator compares two values to see if they are not equal.

=== operator, on the other hand, is a strict equality operator and does not perform type coercion. It will only return true if the values being compared have the same type and value.

	Operator	Usage
	==	qual to
	===	equal value and equal type
    !=	not equal
	!==	not equal value or not equal type */
